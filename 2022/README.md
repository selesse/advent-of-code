## Advent of Code 2022

For now, these are my goals for this year's advent of code.

1. No external libraries.
2. The parts1/parts2 should be as readable as can be.
3. Self-contained: no reuse between days.
4. Don't spend too much time. Try to not be a perfectionist, and let "good
   enough" be good enough.
